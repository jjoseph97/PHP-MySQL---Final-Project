# DMIT2025 - PHP/MySQL Final Project
DMIT2025 - PHP/MySQL final project - *Completed on December 12, 2017*

## Description
This is my final project for the PHP and MySQL course I've taken at Northern Alberta Institute of Technology (NAIT). This project is a catalogue of Church Hymns that I have sung at Christmas.
More information can be found on the homepage of the website.

Included on this website is a basic CRUD functionality for broadway content. I've also included a login so that an
administrator must be logged in prior to accessing these CRUD functions. Additionally, I've added a sidebar for filtering
and the ability for an administrator to insert a YouTube URL when creating or updating a Broadway show. This YouTube URL will
be validated to ensure that it is a real YouTube URL which it will then appear as an embedded video.
